# Outlier-detection-for-volatility-models

This repository contains codes that aim to detect outliers in finacial series perfomed alongside with volatility models.

Following the wavelets-based technique for outliers' correction of Gran√© & Veiga(2010), these codes extend their approach for several GARCH specification. The results are ilustrated in the paper - 'VaR forecasts during the COVID-19 crisis: Comparing GARCH models performances':

The worldwide spread of COVID-19 was responsible for the second deepest fall in the American stock markets history when the share prices plummet more than 13% on March 13, 2020. The sharp downturn generated by the global pandemic put financial risk models to the test. Hence, we compare the performance of GARCH models to forecast 1%-VaR for the Dow Jones returns during the COVID-19 period. We consider the effects of extreme events by employing the wavelets-based technique for outliers' correction. From an initial set of 72 models, the Model Confidence Set procedure is implemented to select specifications with the higher predictive ability. Backtesting measures indicate that asymmetric models with skewed-heavy-tailed distributions are superior to monitor the risk. Moreover, correcting additive outliers in the series leads to a more accurate 1%-VaR coverage during the crisis.
